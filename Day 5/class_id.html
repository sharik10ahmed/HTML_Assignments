    <p class="design_class">This isn't just another chocolate cake—it is the moistest, fudgiest, most intense chocolate experience you
        will ever have. It uses boiling water to "bloom" the cocoa powder, releasing deep flavor notes that standard
        mixing just can't match. Best of all? You only need one bowl and a whisk.
    </p>

    <p id="design_id">Heat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round baking pans.</p>
