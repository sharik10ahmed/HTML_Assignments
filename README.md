# 👋 About Me

Welcome to my personal **HTML5 & Web Structure** repository!

I am **Sharik Ahmed**, a student specializing in **AI/ML**. While my core focus is on logic and backend systems, I am passionate about understanding the foundational structure of the web.

This repository serves as a central hub for my HTML experiments, covering everything from basic tags to semantic document structure and forms.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This collection represents my journey in mastering the skeleton of web development. You will find code covering the following key areas:

### 🌐 Core HTML Structure
* **Document Setup:** Understanding the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` structure.
* **Text Formatting:** Headings, Paragraphs, Lists (Ordered/Unordered), and Span/Div usage.
* **Media Integration:** Embedding Images, Videos, and Audio correctly.

### 📝 Forms & Input
* **Input Types:** Text fields, Checkboxes, Radio buttons, and Date pickers.
* **Form Attributes:** Handling `action`, `method`, and client-side validation using `required`.
* **Labels & Fieldsets:** organizing forms for better accessibility.

### 🏛️ Semantic HTML5
* **Modern Layouts:** Using `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.
* **Tables:** Creating structured data grids with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.

## ✨ Highlights & Standards

I focus on writing **Semantic HTML**, which means using the right tags for the right purpose. Here is what you can expect:

* **Semantic Markup:** Code that is meaningful to both developers and browsers (SEO-friendly).
* **Accessibility (a11y):** Using `alt` text for images and proper `label` tags for form inputs.
* **Clean Indentation:** Writing nested code that is easy to read and debug.
* **W3C Compliance:** Following standard web guidelines to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
